# Markdown Style


> When working with technical documentation using Markdown, there is sometimes a need to provide more detail while keeping *Markdown's seriousness and cool CSS touches together*. This is where such a simple solution comes into play.



#### Usage:


Just put this link in your Markdown file and focus on your docs.


```

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" href="https://thismoree.github.io/md/style.css" />


```
